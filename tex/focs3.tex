% Q1
\item
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Code an analogue of \verb|map| and \verb|filter| for sequences.

    \item Create a lazy list of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item even numbers
        \item square numbers
        \item integers that are not divisible by three
    \end{enumerate}

    \item What happens if you run \verb|filter (x -> x mod 2 = 1)| on the sequence of even numbers? Why?

    \item Define a type representing rational numbers.  
    Then define a lazy list containing positive rational numbers.  
    A number may appear in the sequence multiple times, but all rational numbers should be in the sequence.

    \item (Optional) Define a lazy list containing all finite sets of integers.  
    Is it possible to define a lazy list containing all sets of integers?
\end{enumerate}

% Q2
\item
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare depth-first search, breadth-first search and iterative deepening.  
    What factors decide which technique should be used in a certain scenario?

    \item A lazy binary tree is either empty or is a branch containing a label and two lazy binary trees, possibly to infinite depth.  
    Present an OCaml datatype to represent lazy binary trees, along with a function that accepts a lazy binary tree and produces a lazy list that contains all of the treeâ€™s labels.  
    The order of the elements in the lazy list does not matter, as long as it contains all potential tree nodes.

    \item Define a datatype representing lazy general trees, where nodes may have arbitrarily many (possibly infinitely many) children.

    \item How would you traverse a tree described in part (c)?

    \item (Optional) Define a lazy tree with arbitrarily long paths (i.e. for any integer $n$, there exists a path of length $n$), that has no infinite-length path.
\end{enumerate}
